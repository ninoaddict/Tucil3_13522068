<h1 align="center">Word Ladder Solver</h1>
<h2 id="description">✨ Description </h2>


Word ladder (also known as Doublets, word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, laddergrams, or word golf) is one of the famous word games for all ages. Word ladder was invented by Lewis Carroll, a writer and mathematician, in 1877. In this game, players are given two words called the start word and end word. To win the game, players must find a chain of words that can connect the start word and end word. The number of letters in the start word and end word is always the same. Each word adjacent in the word chain may only differ by one letter. In this game, an optimal solution is expected, which minimizes the number of words inserted into the word chain.
